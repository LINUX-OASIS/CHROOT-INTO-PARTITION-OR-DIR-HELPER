A Bash script that provides a user-friendly `whiptail` interface to easily `chroot` into any available Linux partition or a specified directory. It handles the tedious but essential tasks of mounting pseudo-filesystems and preserving network connectivity, ensuring a fully functional and safe chroot environment.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Interactive TUI**: A simple and intuitive menu-driven interface powered by `whiptail`.
*   **Partition or Directory**: Flexibility to chroot into an auto-detected partition or a manually specified directory.
*   **Automatic Filesystem Management**: Mounts `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`, and `/usr` automatically before entering the chroot.
*   **Network Connectivity**: Preserves the host's network configuration by copying `/etc/resolv.conf` into the chroot.
*   **Safe & Robust Cleanup**: Uses a `trap` on exit to guarantee that all mounts are cleaned up and network settings are restored, even if the script is interrupted.
*   **Dependency Management**: Automatically checks for required commands and prompts the user to install them if they are missing.

---

## üêß OS Compatibility

This script is designed for Debian-based Linux distributions and has been tested on:

*   Debian
*   Ubuntu (all official flavors)
*   Linux Mint
*   Other Debian/Ubuntu derivatives that use the `apt` package manager.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies & Installation

### Dependencies

The script requires the following commands to be installed on your system:
*   `whiptail` (from the `whiptail` package)
*   `lsblk` (from the `util-linux` package)
*   `awk` (from the `gawk` or `mawk` package)

If any of these dependencies are missing, the script will detect them and offer to install them for you automatically using `apt`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LINUX-OASIS/chroot-helper.git
    cd chroot-helper
    ```

2.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x custom-CHROOT-INTO-PARTITION-OR-DIR.sh
    ```

---

## üöÄ Usage

The script must be run with root privileges. Simply execute it with `sudo`:

```bash
sudo ./custom-CHROOT-INTO-PARTITION-OR-DIR.sh
```

You will be presented with a menu to choose whether to chroot into a partition or a directory. Follow the on-screen prompts. To exit the chroot environment, simply type `exit` or press `Ctrl+D`.
